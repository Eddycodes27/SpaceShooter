Initial Screen Image

Airship will be able to go around the whole screen, same with bullets. No limitations. Enemies on the other hand will be fixed to a certain position on every level.

There will be no limit to bullets. Every bullet that makes contact with an enemy will add to the score and decrease enemy health.
